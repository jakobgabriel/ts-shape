"""Quality Events

Detectors for quality-related events: outliers, statistical process control,
and tolerance deviations over time series.

Classes:
- OutlierDetectionEvents: Detect and group outlier events in a time series.
  - detect_outliers_zscore: Detect outliers using Z-score thresholding and group nearby points.
  - detect_outliers_iqr: Detect outliers using IQR bounds and group nearby points.

- StatisticalProcessControlRuleBased: Apply Western Electric rules to actual values
  using tolerance context to flag control-limit violations.
  - calculate_control_limits: Compute mean and ±1/±2/±3 standard-deviation bands from tolerance rows.
  - process: Apply selected rules and emit event rows for violations.
  - rule_1: One point beyond the 3-sigma control limits.
  - rule_2: Nine consecutive points on one side of the mean.
  - rule_3: Six consecutive points steadily increasing or decreasing.
  - rule_4: Fourteen consecutive points alternating up and down.
  - rule_5: Two of three consecutive points near the control limit (between 2 and 3 sigma).
  - rule_6: Four of five consecutive points near the control limit (between 1 and 2 sigma).
  - rule_7: Fifteen consecutive points within 1 sigma of the mean.
  - rule_8: Eight consecutive points on both sides of the mean within 1 sigma.

- ToleranceDeviationEvents: Flag intervals where actual values cross/compare against
  tolerance settings and group them into start/end events.
  - process_and_group_data_with_events: Build grouped deviation events with event UUIDs.

- AnomalyClassificationEvents: Classify anomaly types in numeric signals.
  - classify_anomalies: Detect and classify by type (spike/drift/oscillation/flatline/level_shift).
  - detect_flatline: Signal stuck at constant value.
  - detect_oscillation: Periodic instability detection.
  - detect_drift: Short-term slope-based drift events.

- SignalQualityEvents: Signal data quality monitoring.
  - detect_missing_data: Find gaps exceeding expected sampling frequency.
  - sampling_regularity: Inter-sample interval statistics per window.
  - detect_out_of_range: Flag values outside physical/expected bounds.
  - data_completeness: Percentage of expected samples received per window.

- CapabilityTrendingEvents: Track process capability over rolling time windows.
  - capability_over_time: Cp/Cpk/Pp/Ppk per time window.
  - detect_capability_drop: Alert when Cpk falls below threshold.
  - capability_forecast: Extrapolate Cpk trend to predict threshold breach.
  - yield_estimate: Estimated yield, DPMO, and sigma level per window.

- SensorDriftEvents: Detect calibration drift in inline sensors.
  - detect_zero_drift: Track mean offset from baseline per window.
  - detect_span_drift: Track measurement sensitivity changes over time.
  - drift_trend: Rolling linear trend analysis on signal statistics.
  - calibration_health: Composite health score per window.

- MultiSensorValidationEvents: Cross-validate redundant inline sensors.
  - detect_disagreement: Flag windows where sensor spread exceeds threshold.
  - pairwise_bias: Mean difference between each sensor pair per window.
  - consensus_score: Per-window measurement consensus across sensors.
  - identify_outlier_sensor: Find the sensor furthest from the group.

- GaugeRepeatabilityEvents: Measurement System Analysis (Gauge R&R).
  - repeatability: Equipment Variation (EV) per part.
  - reproducibility: Appraiser Variation (AV) across operators.
  - gauge_rr_summary: Full Gauge R&R table with %GRR and ndc.
  - measurement_bias: Compare measurements to known reference values.

- DataGapAnalysisEvents: Analyse gaps and coverage in signal data.
  - find_gaps: Locate all gaps longer than a threshold.
  - gap_summary: Aggregate statistics across all gaps.
  - coverage_by_period: Data coverage percentage per time window.
  - interpolation_candidates: Gaps small enough to interpolate safely.

- ValueDistributionEvents: Examine signal distribution over time.
  - detect_mode_changes: Detect shifts between distinct operating modes.
  - detect_bimodal: Test whether the signal has a bimodal distribution.
  - normality_windows: Flag time windows with non-normal distributions.
  - percentile_tracking: Track selected percentiles over time windows.
