  using tolerance context to flag control-limit violations.

  - rule_3: Six consecutive points steadily increasing or decreasing.
  - rule_4: Fourteen consecutive points alternating up and down.
  - rule_5: Two of three consecutive points near the control limit (between 2 and 3 sigma).
  - rule_6: Four of five consecutive points near the control limit (between 1 and 2 sigma).
  - rule_7: Fifteen consecutive points within 1 sigma of the mean.
  - rule_8: Eight consecutive points on both sides of the mean within 1 sigma.
