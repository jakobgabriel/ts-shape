# ValueTraceabilityEvents

> Trace a shared identifier across multiple stations (serial number, order ID, batch code).

**Module:** `ts_shape.events.production.order_traceability`
**Guide:** [Traceability Guide](../../guides/traceability.md)

---

## When to Use

Use to track parts, orders, or batches as they move through production stations. Each station has its own UUID signal carrying the current identifier being processed. This module correlates those signals into a unified timeline showing where each item has been and how long it spent at each station.

---

## Quick Example

```python
from ts_shape.events.production.order_traceability import ValueTraceabilityEvents

tracer = ValueTraceabilityEvents(
    df=production_df,
    station_uuids={
        "cutting": "station-uuid-001",
        "welding": "station-uuid-002",
        "painting": "station-uuid-003",
        "assembly": "station-uuid-004",
    }
)

# Build full timeline per identifier per station
timeline = tracer.build_timeline()

# End-to-end lead time per identifier
lead_times = tracer.lead_time()

# Where is each item right now?
status = tracer.current_status()
```

## Key Methods

| Method | Purpose | Returns |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `build_timeline()` | Full timeline per identifier per station | `DataFrame` |
| `lead_time()` | End-to-end lead time per identifier | `DataFrame` |
| `current_status()` | Last known station for each identifier | `DataFrame` |
| `station_dwell_statistics()` | Dwell time statistics per station | `DataFrame` |

## Tips & Hints

!!! tip "Use consistent identifier formats"
    Ensure all stations emit the same identifier format (e.g., zero-padded serial numbers). Mismatched formats will cause the tracer to treat "Order-42" and "Order-042" as different items.
