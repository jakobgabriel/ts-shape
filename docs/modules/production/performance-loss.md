# PerformanceLossTracking

> Track performance and speed losses against target cycle times.

**Module:** `ts_shape.events.production.performance_loss`
**Guide:** [Reporting Guide](../../guides/reporting.md)

---

## When to Use

Use to identify hidden speed losses where the machine runs but slower than target. The "performance" component of OEE, showing where actual cycle time exceeds ideal. This module helps production engineers find periods of reduced speed that may not trigger alarms but still erode throughput over time.

## Quick Example

```python
from ts_shape.events.production.performance_loss import PerformanceLossTracking

tracker = PerformanceLossTracking(
    df=production_df,
    start_time="2024-01-01",
    end_time="2024-01-31"
)

# Performance percentage per shift
perf = tracker.performance_by_shift(
    cycle_uuid="cycle-time-001",
    target_cycle_time=4.5  # seconds
)

# Find periods where performance dropped below 90%
slow = tracker.slow_periods(
    cycle_uuid="cycle-time-001",
    target_cycle_time=4.5,
    threshold_pct=90.0
)

# Daily trend of performance percentage
trend = tracker.performance_trend(
    cycle_uuid="cycle-time-001",
    target_cycle_time=4.5,
    window="1D"
)
```

## Key Methods

| Method | Purpose | Returns |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `performance_by_shift(cycle_uuid, target_cycle_time)` | Performance percentage per shift (ideal / actual) | `DataFrame` |
| `slow_periods(cycle_uuid, target_cycle_time, threshold_pct=90.0)` | Time windows where performance fell below threshold | `DataFrame` |
| `performance_trend(cycle_uuid, target_cycle_time, window='1D')` | Rolling trend of performance percentage | `DataFrame` |

## Tips & Hints

!!! tip "Exclude planned slow-downs"
    If your process has intentional reduced-speed modes (e.g., warm-up, cool-down), filter those periods out before analysis. Otherwise they will appear as false performance losses.
