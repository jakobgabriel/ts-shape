# TargetTracking

> Compare any production metric to targets — every plant has daily/shift targets.

**Module:** `ts_shape.events.production.target_tracking`
**Guide:** [Reporting Guide](../../guides/reporting.md)

---

## When to Use

Use as a generic target vs actual comparison module. Works with any production metric (output, quality, OEE) against per-shift or daily targets. This is the go-to module when management sets numeric goals and you need to report achievement rates over time.

---

## Quick Example

```python
from ts_shape.events.production.target_tracking import TargetTracking

tracker = TargetTracking(
    df=production_df,
    start_time="2024-01-01",
    end_time="2024-01-31"
)

# Compare actual production to shift targets
shift_targets = {"morning": 500, "afternoon": 480, "night": 400}
comparison = tracker.compare_to_target(
    metric_uuid="counter-001",
    targets=shift_targets
)

# Achievement summary over time
summary = tracker.target_achievement_summary(
    metric_uuid="counter-001",
    daily_target=1400
)

# How often do we hit the daily target?
hit_rate = tracker.target_hit_rate(
    metric_uuid="counter-001",
    daily_target=1400
)
```

## Key Methods

| Method | Purpose | Returns |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `compare_to_target(metric_uuid, targets)` | Actual vs target per shift with delta and percentage | `DataFrame` |
| `target_achievement_summary(metric_uuid, daily_target)` | Daily achievement percentage over the analysis period | `DataFrame` |
| `target_hit_rate(metric_uuid, daily_target)` | Percentage of days/shifts where target was met or exceeded | `float` |

## Tips & Notes

!!! tip "Adjust targets for product mix"
    A flat daily target works when producing a single product. If your line runs multiple variants with different cycle times, pass product-weighted targets to get meaningful achievement rates.
