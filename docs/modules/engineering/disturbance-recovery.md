# DisturbanceRecoveryEvents

> Detect external upsets hitting a process signal and measure recovery.

**Module:** `ts_shape.events.engineering.disturbance_recovery`  
**Guide:** [Process Engineering](../../guides/engineering.md)

---

## When to Use

Use to detect and characterize external process upsets (material changes, ambient disturbances, upstream failures) and measure how quickly the process recovers. Critical for root cause analysis and for quantifying process robustness against unplanned events.

---

## Quick Example

```python
from ts_shape.events.engineering.disturbance_recovery import DisturbanceRecoveryEvents

analyzer = DisturbanceRecoveryEvents(
    df=process_data,
    uuid="reactor_temperature_01"
)

# Detect disturbances exceeding 3 sigma from baseline
disturbances = analyzer.detect_disturbances(
    baseline_window="10m",
    threshold_sigma=3.0
)

# Measure recovery time for each disturbance
recovery = analyzer.recovery_time(
    baseline_window="10m",
    recovery_pct=0.95
)

# Count disturbances per 8-hour shift
frequency = analyzer.disturbance_frequency(window="8h")

# Compare process behavior before vs after each upset
comparison = analyzer.before_after_comparison(baseline_window="10m")
```

## Key Methods

| Method | Purpose | Returns |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `detect_disturbances(baseline_window='10m', threshold_sigma=3.0)` | Detect process upsets | DataFrame of disturbance events |
| `recovery_time(baseline_window='10m', recovery_pct=0.95)` | Recovery time per disturbance | DataFrame with recovery metrics |
| `disturbance_frequency(window='8h')` | Count disturbances per window | DataFrame with counts |
| `before_after_comparison(baseline_window='10m')` | Before vs after statistics | DataFrame with comparison stats |

## Tips & Hints

!!! tip "Correlate disturbances with upstream events"
    After detecting disturbances, use `before_after_comparison()` to quantify the impact, then cross-reference timestamps with upstream signals or operator logs to identify root causes. Pair with `disturbance_frequency()` to spot recurring patterns.
