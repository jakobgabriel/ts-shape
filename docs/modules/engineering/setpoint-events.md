# SetpointChangeEvents

> Detect step/ramp changes on a setpoint signal and compute follow-up KPIs like time-to-settle and overshoot.

**Module:** `ts_shape.events.engineering.setpoint_events`  
**Guide:** [Process Engineering](../../guides/engineering.md)

---

## When to Use

Use when analyzing PID or setpoint-based control systems. Detects recipe changes and computes ISA/control-engineering KPIs like settling time, rise time, and overshoot. Ideal for evaluating controller tuning and recipe transition performance.

---

## Quick Example

```python
from ts_shape.events.engineering.setpoint_events import SetpointChangeEvents

detector = SetpointChangeEvents(
    df=process_data,
    uuid="setpoint_temperature_01"
)

# Detect all setpoint step changes
steps = detector.detect_setpoint_steps(min_delta=5.0, min_hold="30s")

# Measure how quickly the actual signal settles after each change
settling = detector.time_to_settle(
    actual_uuid="actual_temperature_01",
    tol=0.5,
    settle_pct=0.02
)

# Get comprehensive control quality metrics
quality = detector.control_quality_metrics(
    actual_uuid="actual_temperature_01",
    tol=0.5
)
```

## Tips & Notes

!!! tip "Combine steps and ramps for full coverage"
    Use `detect_setpoint_changes()` instead of calling steps and ramps separately. This gives you a unified table that captures both instantaneous recipe changes and gradual ramp profiles.
