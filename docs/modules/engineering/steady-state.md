# SteadyStateDetectionEvents

> Identify when a process signal has settled into a steady operating state versus transient/dynamic periods.

**Module:** `ts_shape.events.engineering.steady_state_detection`  
**Guide:** [Process Engineering](../../guides/engineering.md)

## When to Use

Use to segment process data into steady-state vs transient periods. Essential for valid statistical analysis — SPC and capability indices are only meaningful on steady-state data. Also useful for filtering out startup, shutdown, and transition periods before computing KPIs.

## Quick Example

```python
from ts_shape.events.engineering.steady_state_detection import SteadyStateDetectionEvents

detector = SteadyStateDetectionEvents(
    df=process_data,
    uuid="reactor_temperature_01"
)

# Detect steady-state intervals
steady = detector.detect_steady_state(
    window="5m",
    std_threshold=1.0,
    min_duration="10m"
)

# Get transient periods (inverse of steady state)
transients = detector.detect_transient_periods(
    window="5m",
    std_threshold=1.0
)

# Identify distinct operating bands within steady state
bands = detector.steady_state_value_bands(window="5m")
```

## Key Methods

| Method | Purpose | Returns |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `detect_steady_state(window='5m', std_threshold=1.0, min_duration='10m')` | Steady-state intervals | DataFrame of steady intervals |
| `detect_transient_periods(window='5m', std_threshold=1.0)` | Transient/dynamic intervals | DataFrame of transient intervals |
| `steady_state_statistics(window='5m')` | Summary statistics | DataFrame with steady-state stats |
| `steady_state_value_bands(window='5m')` | Distinct operating bands | DataFrame of value bands |

## Tips & Notes

!!! tip "Tune std_threshold to your process noise"
    The default `std_threshold=1.0` works for many signals, but noisy sensors may need a higher value. Start by looking at `steady_state_statistics()` output and adjust until the detected intervals match your engineering judgment.
