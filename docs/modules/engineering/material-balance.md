# MaterialBalanceEvents

> Check whether inputs and outputs balance (mass, energy, flow) per time window.

**Module:** `ts_shape.events.engineering.material_balance`  
**Guide:** [Process Engineering](../../guides/engineering.md)

---

## When to Use

Use as a fundamental daily engineering check for any process. Validates conservation of mass/energy across inputs and outputs. Imbalances indicate leaks, measurement errors, or unaccounted streams. Essential for process accounting, yield tracking, and regulatory compliance.

## Quick Example

```python
from ts_shape.events.engineering.material_balance import MaterialBalanceEvents

checker = MaterialBalanceEvents(
    df=flow_data,
    uuid="input_flow_total"
)

# Check balance within 5% tolerance per hour
balance = checker.balance_check(window="1h", tolerance_pct=5.0)

# Track imbalance trend over time
trend = checker.imbalance_trend(window="1h")

# Detect sustained imbalance periods
exceedances = checker.detect_balance_exceedance(
    window="1h",
    tolerance_pct=5.0
)

# Break down each signal's contribution to the imbalance
breakdown = checker.contribution_breakdown(window="1h")
```

## Key Methods

| Method | Purpose | Returns |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `balance_check(window='1h', tolerance_pct=5.0)` | Balance pass/fail per window | DataFrame with balance status |
| `imbalance_trend(window='1h')` | Imbalance trend over time | DataFrame with imbalance values |
| `detect_balance_exceedance(window='1h', tolerance_pct=5.0)` | Sustained imbalance intervals | DataFrame of exceedance events |
| `contribution_breakdown(window='1h')` | Signal-level contributions | DataFrame with per-signal breakdown |

## Tips & Notes

!!! tip "Start with contribution_breakdown when imbalance is detected"
    When `balance_check()` fails, use `contribution_breakdown()` to identify which specific input or output stream is responsible. This narrows the investigation to one sensor or pipe instead of chasing the entire process.
