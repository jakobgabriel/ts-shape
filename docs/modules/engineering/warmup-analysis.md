# WarmUpCoolDownEvents

> Detect and characterize warm-up and cool-down curves for ovens, extruders, molds, hydraulic systems.

**Module:** `ts_shape.events.engineering.warmup_analysis`  
**Guide:** [Process Engineering](../../guides/engineering.md)

---

## When to Use

Use for thermal equipment (ovens, extruders, molds) where warm-up and cool-down phases impact production planning and energy consumption. Tracks warm-up consistency over time to detect degrading heating elements or insulation, and measures time-to-target for scheduling.

## Quick Example

```python
from ts_shape.events.engineering.warmup_analysis import WarmUpCoolDownEvents

analyzer = WarmUpCoolDownEvents(
    df=oven_data,
    uuid="oven_temperature_zone1"
)

# Detect warm-up intervals (rising at least 50 deg over 1+ min)
warmups = analyzer.detect_warmup(min_rise=50.0, min_duration="1m")

# Detect cool-down intervals
cooldowns = analyzer.detect_cooldown(min_fall=30.0, min_duration="1m")

# Check consistency of warm-up curves across days
consistency = analyzer.warmup_consistency(
    min_rise=50.0,
    min_duration="1m"
)

# Time to reach 180C operating temperature
time_to_temp = analyzer.time_to_target(
    target_value=180.0,
    direction="rising"
)
```

| Method | Purpose | Returns |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `detect_warmup(min_rise, min_duration='1m')` | Warm-up interval detection | DataFrame of warm-up events |

## Tips & Hints

!!! tip "Track warm-up consistency for predictive maintenance"
    A gradually increasing time-to-target across weeks indicates degrading heating elements, fouled heat exchangers, or deteriorating insulation. Plot `warmup_consistency()` output over time to set up early maintenance alerts.

!!! info "Related modules"

    - [Rate of Change](rate-of-change.md) — monitor the ramp rate during warm-up
    - [Steady State Detection](steady-state.md) — detect when the warm-up phase ends and steady state begins
